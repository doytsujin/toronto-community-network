# Toronto Community Network

>Community networks are networks collectively owned and managed by the community for non-profit and community purposes. They are constituted by collectives, indigenous communities or non-profit civil society organizations that exercise their right to communicate, under the principles of democratic participation of their members, equity, gender equality, diversity and plurality.

We are building a community network in Toronto alongside our collaborators.
See our [proposal brief](https://github.com/tomeshnet/toronto-community-network/blob/master/operations/published-documents/Brief-v002.pdf) and [full in-draft proposal](https://github.com/tomeshnet/toronto-community-network/blob/master/operations/published-documents/proposal-draft-v003.pdf) for details.

## Project Management
We use [Teams](https://github.com/orgs/tomeshnet/teams/toronto-community-network/teams) to manage membership of working groups and [Projects](https://github.com/tomeshnet/toronto-community-network/projects/1) to track task status on a public project board.
These are our current [working groups](https://github.com/orgs/tomeshnet/teams/toronto-community-network/teams).

### Communications and Community Engagement [:busts_in_silhouette:](https://github.com/orgs/tomeshnet/teams/communications-and-community-engagement)
Connect with people living and working in the areas served by the network(s), inform people regarding intentions and activities of the community network and engage them in dialogue with a view to mutual learning and collaboration in advancing the value of the network and related opportunities in the community.
