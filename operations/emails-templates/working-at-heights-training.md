Toronto Mesh is planning to allocate funding to train 2 members for working at heights, from a provider approved by the Chief Prevention Officer (CPO). The training is valid for 3 years, after which the member may take a refresher to extend its validity, but that falls outside the scope of our sponsorship and the member is under no obligation to extend it.

The expectation is that the certified members will be actively involved and be available for some of our Toronto Community Network supernode deployments, and help ensure deployments are carried out safely for themselves and other members at deployment events. Having the certification does not, however, place them in a position of legal liability for the safety of other members. Members are independently responsible for their own safety.

You can find more information about the training [here](https://www.ontario.ca/page/training-working-heights) and an approved provider from [this list](https://www.ontario.ca/page/training-working-heights#section-1). Trainings are generally one-day, and the top of the list has blended sessions that consists of a 4.5h virtual + 3.5h in-person component. For example, blended sessions by [4S](https://www.4sconsult.com/blended-working-at-heights-training/) and [4 YOUR SAFETY](https://www.4yoursafety.ca/booking) may be more suitable for individuals with regular work schedules.

You are free to select an approved provider near you. Toronto Mesh will cover up to CAD 170 + tax upon completion, provided that the member:

- has passed the training
- provide a copy (digital) of the receipt of the training
- provide a copy (digital) of the [proof of training](https://www.ontario.ca/page/training-working-heights#proof)
- agree to work with our collaborators to verify their training record upon request

Please email operations@tomesh.net to apply. We will prioritize candidates who are currently involved in deployment activities, and get back to you by August 28, 2020. Once accepted, please schedule your session shortly and remember to take COVID-19 precautions and call the provider first to confirm training schedules during the pandemic.
